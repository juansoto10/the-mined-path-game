                    Welcome to The Minefield and The Parrot Game! <br>
                    In this simple game you have to guide the mother parrot to her nest through several levels. A cruel human cut the feathers off her wings but she managed to escape and now she has to walk, avoiding the multiple bombs that are along the way. <br>
                    Can you help the mother parrot to be happy and reunite with her beautiful family? At the end you will see the time it took you to achieve it. Dare to break a new record!
